-used PIC C compiler and a PIC 18f1330
-this code is to generate a 3phase signal that starts slow and speeds up to final value
-voltage to frequancy ratio V/F is constant so the current and tourque stays constant as the motor speeds up
-a button to stop and start the motor
gives maximum magnitude and 200Hz sinusoidal wave
